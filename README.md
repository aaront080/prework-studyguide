# Prework Study Guide Site

## Create a webpage to house and collect all the information we have learned from the prework course. Our webpage consists of 4 sections that house each of the topics that we covered in the prework course.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- This was a great introduction to the four different topics that we will be going over in more depth during this bootcamp. I was able to gain valuable exposure to basics in JS, CSS, HTML, and Git.
- Building this site gave me a real world practice of the kinds of duties I would have as a full stack web developer. 
- In building this site, not only was I able to gain experience in web development but was also able to create a place for me to keep all the information I have leanred from this course in one easy to reach place.
- I was really able to gain exposure to using the different programming lauguages in web development and how they all link together.

## Usage

This simple wabpage allows us to keep note and information that we have learned in one place. We are able to easily revisit this information when we need and are also able to continue to add new notes and information as we progress through the coding bootcamp. We can see the JS running if we use the chromeDevTools console and are also able to utilize JS to help us decide which topic to study first.
